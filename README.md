# Solutions for USC's Qualifying Exams in Mathematics
The USC Mathematics Graduate Student Association (MGSA) has [solutions to old qualifying exams](https://dornsife.usc.edu/mgsa/quals/) on their website submitted by other graduate students.
This project is an attempt to have open-source solutions written in LaTeX so that other students can fix mistakes and add solutions to other exams.
